  about: [
    "I'm Prince Ekpinse, a Junior Front-End Developer from Benin, passionate about crafting intuitive, responsive, and creative web experiences. With solid expertise in React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, I transform ideas into clean, interactive interfaces that engage users and bring digital products to life.",

    "I love building projects that combine functionality and design — from personal ventures like LinkVibe, H-Calendar, and my YouTube Thumbnail Generator, to exploring APIs, real-time analytics, and innovative front-end solutions. I thrive at the intersection of code, UX, and performance, always pushing the limits of what web interfaces can achieve.",

    "Beyond coding, I actively share my journey and insights in the African tech community on LinkedIn, building in public, inspiring young developers, and contributing to collaborative, tech-for-good initiatives. I'm open to freelance projects, partnerships, and opportunities where creativity meets code.",
